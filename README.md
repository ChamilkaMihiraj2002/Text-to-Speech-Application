Project Overview

This Text to Speech (TTS) application is a user-friendly tool designed to convert written text into spoken words. Built using Python with a Tkinter-based GUI, it leverages the pyttsx3 library for speech synthesis. Users can input text, select the desired voice (Male or Female), and choose the speech speed (Fast, Normal, or Slow). The application offers both playback functionality and the ability to save the spoken text as an MP3 file.

	Speed Control: Adjust the speech rate to Fast, Normal, or Slow.
	Text Input Area: Easily input and edit text within the application.
	Playback: Listen to the converted text directly through the application.
	Save to File: Save the spoken text as an MP3 file for later use.
